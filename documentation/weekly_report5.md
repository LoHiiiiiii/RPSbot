# Weekly Report 5

This week was mostly dedicated to unit testing. Progress elsewhere is minimal, mostly because I am out of the country for over half the week and I spent quite a lot of time trying figuring out the History String Matching primary strategy. I still am not sure how to implement it, especially in the corner cases where the player has played only one move (is it still random or a "pattern"). I ended up cutting the class since even after some pondering it was still basically empty.
