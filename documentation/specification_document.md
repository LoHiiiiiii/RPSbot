# Specification Document

As I have not yet done the research to know what kind of algorithms AI that plays RPS uses, I cannot yet list them. However, whatever they are, I expect to have to create at the very least my own HashMap data structure.

The software will be a simple text userinterface where the player can input one of the three moves, then the software will input its move and tell you the overall score.
