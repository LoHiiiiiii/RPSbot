# Instructions

To run the program, first download the .zip file from the release. It contains a .jar file, which you need to unzip into a location of your choosing. Traverse to this location in your command console, then execute the command "java -jar RPSBot.jar". This opens the bot, which allows you to play it in a first to 20 set. Inputting any string that starts with r plays rock, anystring with p paper and any string with s scissors. Invalid input asks you again. Once one player reaches 20 wins, the program will end.
